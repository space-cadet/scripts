### META-1: Memory Bank Maintenance
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress
**Progress**:
1. ✅ Created T3 task documentation
2. ✅ Updated T2 and T3 task files with accurate status
3. ✅ Created implementation docs for all three projects
4. ✅ Examined actual code vs documented status
5. ✅ Created overall project README
6. ✅ Created conda-env-backup README

## Context and Working State
Conducted comprehensive review of all active projects (T1, T2, T3) by examining actual code versus memory bank documentation. Discovered that all three projects are more complete than documented. Updated task files to reflect accurate completion status. Created detailed implementation documentation for all three projects to preserve technical knowledge.

## Critical Files
- `memory-bank/tasks/T1.md`: Task documentation
- `memory-bank/tasks/T2.md`: Updated with error handling completion
- `memory-bank/tasks/T3.md`: Updated with full feature list
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/screenshot-compression-implementation.md`: Created (new)
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/pdf-to-png-implementation.md`: Created (new)
- `memory-bank/implementation-details/conda-env-backup-implementation.md`: Created (new)
- `README.md`: Created overall project README (new)
- `conda-env-backup/README.md`: Created conda manager README (new)

## Session Notes
Memory bank accuracy assessment revealed all three projects have production-ready code with comprehensive error handling and features. T2's error handling was already complete but documented as incomplete. T3's script is highly sophisticated with 621 lines including fzf integration, color-coded output, and fallback mechanisms. Created detailed implementation documentation for all projects to preserve architectural decisions, technical details, and design rationale. Created comprehensive READMEs for overall project and conda environment backup manager to improve accessibility and usability.
